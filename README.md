ðŸš—ðŸ”‹ Electric Vehicle Market Analysis Using Python ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

I'm excited to share my latest project where I analyzed the electric vehicle (EV) market using #Python and key libraries: #Pandas, #Matplotlib, #Seaborn, and #SciPy.

In this analysis, I explored:

Electric Range Distribution: Insights into the most common ranges for EVs.

Historical and Future Trends: Observations on how EV ranges have evolved and what the future might hold.

BEVs vs. PHEVs: Comparison of average electric ranges.

Top 10 EV Models: Highlighting models with the best range.

Market Size Forecast: Projecting the growth of EV registrations in the coming years.

I hope this analysis provides valuable insights into the future of electric vehicles. Feel free to connect with me for further discussion or collaboration!
